# localStorage Implementation Documentation

## Overview
The AI Content Generator now implements localStorage to persist user inputs and outputs between browser sessions. This ensures users don't lose their work when refreshing the page or returning later.

## What Gets Saved
- **Prompt text**: The main input text describing what content to generate
- **Content type**: Selected content type (blog-post, marketing-copy, etc.)
- **Tone**: Selected tone (professional, casual, etc.)
- **Length**: Selected length (short, medium, long)
- **Generated content**: The AI-generated output text

## Storage Keys
All localStorage keys are prefixed with `ai-generator-` for organization:
- `ai-generator-prompt`
- `ai-generator-content-type`
- `ai-generator-tone`
- `ai-generator-length`
- `ai-generator-output`

## Features
- ✅ **Auto-save**: All changes are automatically saved as you type/select
- ✅ **SSR Safe**: Handles server-side rendering without errors
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles localStorage quota limits or disabled storage
- ✅ **Clear Function**: Users can clear all saved data with confirmation dialog
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Copy success notifications and auto-save indicators

## User Experience
- Data persists across page refreshes and browser sessions
- No manual save button needed - everything saves automatically
- Clear indication that data is being saved
- Option to clear all data when needed
- Copy to clipboard with success feedback

## Technical Implementation
- Custom `useLocalStorage` hook handles all storage operations
- `useFormPersistence` hook provides high-level interface for form data
- Proper TypeScript typing for all storage operations
- Error boundaries prevent localStorage issues from breaking the app

## Browser Compatibility
Works in all modern browsers that support:
- localStorage API
- JSON.parse/stringify
- React hooks

## Privacy
All data is stored locally in the user's browser only. No data is sent to external servers except during AI generation API calls.
